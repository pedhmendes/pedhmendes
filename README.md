### Intro ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Pedro Henrique Mendes. 
I'm in the last semester of my bachelor's degree in physics.
My interest topics are: (_i_) Simulations of statistical physics models, such as Ising and Potts, and (_ii_) physics-driven machine learning.


In my repositories you can find all my computational physics projects made through my undergrad studies.
Do not hesitate in contact me if you find anything wrong or that is not working.

### Info ðŸ’¬
